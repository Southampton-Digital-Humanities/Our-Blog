Welcome to [Digital Preservation Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/digital-preservation-southampton)'s newest blogging platform. On here, we will be posting a series of pieces that reflect our interests and commitments to digital cultural heritage, and the sorts of problematics and challenges that we are thinking about. We hope this provides an incentive for discussion and contributes to the dissemination of DPS' work in the sector.

Enjoy the read!
