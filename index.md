Welcome to the newest blog platform for [Digital Preservation Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/digital-preservation-southampton), an enterprise unit embedded within Digital Humanities at the University of Southampton. On here, we will be posting a series of pieces that reflect our interests and commitments to digital cultural heritage and the digital humanities, and document our partnerships with organisations. We hope this provides an incentive for discussion and contributes to the dissemination of our work in the sector.

Enjoy the read!
