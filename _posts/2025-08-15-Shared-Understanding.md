Earlier this summer, the Digital Preservation Southampton team was awarded Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF) to support a knowledge exchange partnership with Lambeth Palace Library. The project aimed to build a shared understanding of the challenges, complexities, and opportunities for complex public organisations like LPL in building digital preservation workflows and systems into their operations. Building on our previous work in the Critical Cataloguing for Digital Preservation AHRC project with Joash Johnson, we organised a series of user discovery sessions aimed at bringing together key stakeholders within the LPL team to discuss their vision for a successful digital preservation system.
